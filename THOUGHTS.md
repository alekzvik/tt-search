My plan for this task is:
1. Implement dummy API that returns data in right format
2. Implement fetching on frontend, check it shows something
3. Add .csv file parsing
4. Add filters one by one
5. Optimize where needed

By working this way at each step of the process I will have working solution, but with limited functions.
